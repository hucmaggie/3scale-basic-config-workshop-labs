# Goals {#goals}

1.  Integrate this simple **_unmanaged_** API Endpoint into 3scale https://tc-apis.herokuapp.com/flights/intl/flights (**Note, this is a test API on Heroku. The first time it is hit every hour is slow)
2.  Demonstrate the main 3scale API Management features typically required for a _basic POC_ – including
    1.  Access Control
    2.  Policy Enforcement
    3.  Analytics
    4.  Swagger &amp; Basic Developer Portal Configuration
3.  Gain familiarity with the 2 Web Portals 3scale exposes
    1.  Admin Portal. Used by: The API Provider – or organization **_exposing_** the API, e.g. United Airlines.
    2.  Developer Portal. Used by: API consumers, e.g. Sites and mobile Apps **_using_** the APIs – e.g. Expedia, CheapOAir etc.
